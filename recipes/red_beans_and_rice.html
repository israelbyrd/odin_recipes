      <h3>Description</h3>
      Red beans and rice is a great dish to cook on sunday to keep in the fridge and eat as needed the throughout the week. I hate sites with rambling stories so here's the recipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>1 pound red kidney beans</li>
	<li>kosher salt</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil or lard</li>
	<li>1 pound cooked andouille sausage, cut into 0.5 inch disks</li>
	<li>1 large yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
	<li>1 green bell pepper, finely chopped</li>
	<li>4 ribs celery, finely chopped</li>
	<li>4 medium cloves garlic, minced</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon ground cayenne pepper</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon ground sage</li>
	<li>fresh ground black pepper</li>
	<li>4 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
	<li>3 bay leaves</li>
	<li>hot sauce (to taste)</li>
	<li>cider vinegar (to taste)</li>

    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
	<li>Submerge beans in 6 cups of cold water in large bowl.</li>
	<li>Stir in 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Leave at room temperature for 8 to 16 hours.</li>
	<li>Drain and rinse beans.</li>
	<li>Heat oil or lard over medium-high heat in large Dutch oven. Add andouille sausage and stir until lightly browned.</li>
	<li>Add onion, bell pepper, celery, and season with salt.</li>
	<li>Cook, stirring until vegetables have softened and start to brown at edges, about 8 minutes.</li>
	<li>Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
	<li>Add Cayenne pepper, sage, and 10 grinds of black pepper.</li>
	<li>Cook, stirring until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
	<li>Add beans along with enough water to cover by about 2 inches.</li>
	<li>Add bay leaves.</li>
	<li>Bring to a boil then reduce heat to a bare simmer.</li>
	<li>Cover and cook until beans are completely tender, about 1.5 to 2.5 hours.</li>
	<li>Remove lid and continue to cook. Stir occasionally until liquid has thickened and turned creamy, about 20 minutes.</li>
	<li>For best texture, refrigerate overnight.</li>
	<li>Serve red beans over steamed white rice. Season to taste with hot sauce, cider vinegar, salt, and pepper.</li>
      </ol>
