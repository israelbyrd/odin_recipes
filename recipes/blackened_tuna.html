      <h3 class="description">Description</h3>
      Spicy tuna is a tasty healthy meal. Use the blackened seasoning on other fish or chicken as well. Cook in a cast iron skillet any time of year or grill them in the summer months. Instead of a rambling 2 paragraph description of my childhood and how I learned this recipe, here are the instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="ingredients">
	<li>Blackened seasoning</li>
	<ul>
	  <li>2 tablespoons smoked paprika (regular paprika OK but not as good).</li>
	  <li>1 tablespoon cayenne powder (more for spicier taste).</li>
	  <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
	  <li>1 teaspoon sea salt</li>
	  <li>0.5 teaspoon dried basil</li>
	  <li>0.5 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
	  <li>0.5 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
	</ul>
	<li>1.5 pounds fresh tuna steaks, 1 inch thick.</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
      <ol class="instructions">
	<li>Mix blackened seasoning ingredients in a large mixing bowl.</li>
	<li>Generously coat tuna with blackened seasoning on all sides (including 1 inch thick edges).</li>
	<li>Heat oil and butter in large skillet over high heat.</li>
	<li>Place steaks in pan when oil is nearly smoking</li>
	<li>Cook one side for 3 to 4 minutes or until blackened.</li>
	<li>Turn steaks and cook on other side for 3 to 4 minutes or to desired doneness.</li>
	<li>FDA recommends in internal temperature of 145 F for seafood. However, cooking rare or mid-rare is typically safe as long as the surface temperature and duration is appropriately high to kill bacteria. </li>
      </ol>
